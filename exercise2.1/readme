Question:

You need to build a very simple client-server operation using the Stream capabilities.
You are to build a client and server pair, to implement your own little directory
service. Suppose that the server has the following database
    0 Bob
    3 Anne
    5 Barb
    7 Ray
    9 Denbigh
    10 Terri
    104 John
This can be in a file that is read. The client is to read a request, which is a numeric
address to be sent to the server. The servers look up the matching name and send it
back to the client to be printed out. If the address isn't found, the server should send
back an error message. For example, "Address not found".


Output:
    Server:
        jay@jay-VirtualBox:~/workspace/Work/SocketExercise/exercise2.1$ ./server 
        Sock created 
        Sock binded
